About
Roguey is a very basic 2D roguelike dungeon crawler I created as my final submission to the Game Design and Production unit ( CSP2107 ) I undertook at ECU during the first semester of 2011.
I've been itching to play a few roguelikes (akin to nethack and co), so I though that I would create one. I initially had bright starry eyed ideas to make a party based combat simulator of sorts, but at the time I was swamped by other tasks and assignments and this really limited the amount of time I had to work on this.
In spite of all the features I cut and all the concessions I had to make, this was easily one of the best games at the presentation.
With that said, I have no intention of further supporting this project and I hope you enjoy it.

Dependencies
SDL
SDL_image
GL (if you have 3D acceleration, you have this)

Compiling
Linux: Make -C src install, a 64bit executable is included (note, debug configuration)
Windows: use the codeblocks project inside src, a binary compiled under wine via mingw is included



Premise
The nearby town, built atop the dungeon has been plagued by  monsters recently, and you have been hired to clean the place up. So your goal in short is to get to the bottom of the dungeon (though I didn't get around to that)

Instructions
use QWE, ASD and ZXC to move.
move against enemies to attack them
descend levels to regain health
you power up everytime you gain 100 points
